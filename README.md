# Unexpected Counter Behavior in Expo ScrollView

This repository demonstrates a peculiar issue encountered when using a counter within a ScrollView component in Expo's React Native environment.  Under certain conditions (especially rapid increments), the counter may fail to update correctly or the UI might not refresh as expected.  The solution provided addresses this by optimizing the state update mechanism and preventing unnecessary re-renders.

## Problem Description

The primary problem lies in the way React Native handles updates within a performant ScrollView.  In certain scenarios, especially during rapid increments or complex UI updates, there's a mismatch between the state and what's rendered on screen.  The counter will fail to reflect accurate changes.

## Solution

The solution employs a more controlled approach to updating the counter by using `useCallback` to optimize the function.  This ensures consistent behavior regardless of the frequency of state updates. 

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2.  Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Start the Expo app using `expo start`.
